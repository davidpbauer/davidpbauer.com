    <meta name="description" content="David P. Bauer; My leadership philosophy intertwines compassion with strategy, focusing on the human side of technology. Recognizing that behind every technological decision in higher education lies the impact on students, faculty, and staff, I am dedicated to understanding and addressing their diverse needs. My approach balances innovative solutions with practical considerations, carefully evaluating new technologies for their capacity to enhance our mission while considering cost, support, and reliability. I advocate for innovative thinking and continuous improvement to build a culture of comfort during periods of adaptation and change. I emphasize collaborative environments, drawing on diverse skills and perspectives to create trust and safety while ensuring technological initiatives respect and enhance human relationships. My approach is based on optimizing resources and creating a robust, scalable, and user-friendly technology infrastructure to improve operational efficiency.">
